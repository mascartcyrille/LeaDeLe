# Preface
This is a small tutorial about learning deep learning, with a bit of theory, some applications and a lot of fun!

I am building this notebook as a testament of my training and learning of machine learning, and deep learning in particular. I will consider that the reader have the same knowledge as I have about deep learning, and has the same required knowledge. Since I own a Ph.D. in computer science, I expect that basic programming skills and basic math knowledge have been acquired by the reader.
